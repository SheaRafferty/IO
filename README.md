# IO
Input/Output Java Project:

In this project I learned how to both read and write to files using Java. I found you have two options for representing files in the file system using the Path or File classes. For writing to files we can put objects of either to the FileWriter class or BufferedWriter class. I also learned that a FileWriter is instantiated with a File object and if we expect to make many small writes to the file we can create a BufferedWriter from the FileWriter.

Task 1;
Writing via FileWriter object

Reading lines from the console

Output file echoes console input

Task2;
Scanner object for “userEcho.txt” & “userNumbers.txt” 

Output lines from “userEcho.txt” in all upper-case

Output numbers from “userNumbers.txt” divided by 2
